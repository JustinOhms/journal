# Heres a perfect example for why we need the Idea's stored seperately
I just had a new idea for a feature.
It's short and small.
But this commit is going to look huge because of the really big active ideas.

It'd be nice to be able to just save a new Idea without all the noise from the others.
Would clean up the commit messages and make what's happening much more clear.
