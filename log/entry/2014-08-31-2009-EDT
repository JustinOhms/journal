# LOG | Mostly finished the journal/init package
Completed the specification and implementation of the functions provided by the `journal/init` package.
I believe the specifications cover all the use cases.
When I'm implementing the command I believe I will have to bubble a git.Commitable object from the `init.Journal(directory)` function.

I'm going to move forward and implement the `journal init` command.
I've modified the proposed flags for `journal init` to align with the immediate uses of the command.
