# Playing w/ the Idea of keeping a log in repo
Had this idea.
Why not keep a log as part of the project's repository.
Sounds like a fun idea for lots of reasons.

- A place to keep notes
- Something about the project's creation that non-programmer and read
- A really great way to showcase this project

What follows is a data type I want to store inside an entry.
