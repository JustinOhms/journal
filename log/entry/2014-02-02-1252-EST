# Stuck with low motivation
I'm fighting myself about how to specify the behavior of the idea package.
There so many possible cases that I just don't know how to specify them.

    - 1 new idea
    - 2 new ideas
    - 1 idea with id
    - 1 idea with id and a new idea

The list could go on.
That's the thing that's bugging me I suppose.
Should I make the framework to have an unlimited number of ideas?
Should the specs for all these cases translate into something testable for the storage?

Am I over thinking it?

I think I'm just not in it today despite really wanting this feature.
I'll revisit it later, for now I need to do something else and let my mind wander.
