## [active] [4] Missing Specifications
In a rush to get Idea's functional enough to use today I passed over a few specifications.
On top of that the terminal usage needs to be specified.
Realized that it wasn't a difficult task today, see main_test.go, and made specs for a few of todays additions

- [ ] Spec the terminal usage of the `journal` command
- [ ] Spec the "lastTwoBytes" tidbit
- [ ] From now on all flags and terminal interaction will be specced
- [ ] Spec the config to expand environment variables on the Directory
- [ ] During the newEntry func -> type conversion rewrite all specifications as the behavior is introduced to avoid missing anything
