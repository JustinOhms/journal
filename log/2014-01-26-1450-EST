#~ Playing w/ the Idea of keeping a log in repo
Had this idea.
Why not keep a log as part of the project's repository.
Sounds like a fun idea for lots of reasons.

- A place to keep notes
- Something about the project's creation that non-programmer and read
- A really great way to showcase this project

What follows is a data type I want to store inside an entry.

## [active] Idea Management
This is an Idea.
An Idea can have a task list and a status[active|inactive|completed]

To find the currently active ideas, you search the previous journal entry.
All active Ideas found in the previous entry will be carried over to a new entry.

All tasks will be bound to an Idea.
Expected line form will be as follows.

- [ ] Task - {{.TaskText}}

If a task is checked off in an journal entry it is removed from the ideas task list with a commit.
The commit is seperate from the commit for the journal entry itself.

To make an Idea inactive you change the status to inactive in the journal entry.
An inactive Idea will not be carried into the next new entry.
To make an Idea active you type some sort of valid go template command.

Something like this perhaps?:
{{.Task.Find("Idea Manager")}}

And then when you save the entry file `journal` will use the file as a template and expand it.
