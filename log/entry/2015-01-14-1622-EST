# journal - Documenting some cleanup tasks
While the code is functional, their are still many ways I can improve the source.
I am mostly speaking to repetitive verbose specifications that can be refactored.
Another target would be elevating the tests to the highest level.
Using only the public interface to setup and specify the expectation.

This may not be possible.
Should something be exposed through the public interface only so it can be mocked?
That seems just as bad as tying it to a private interface.

The only real use case I'm imagining is if an external package ALSO needs to mock it.
This could actually happen if I elevate the tests to the highest level.
In theory I like this idea, but I also don't like it.
Maybe I should reach out at hacker school and have a discussion with someone about it.
