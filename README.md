# Personal Journaling Command

This program is intended to help me write and enjoy writing my personal journal. The output is intended to be stored in a git repository as plain text, somewhat Mark'ed-down.

## Potential ways to expand this simple project

- [ ] Watch the journal entry file after it is created and store the time the entry was completed
- [ ] When the entry is completed store automatically make a git commit
- [ ] Link journal stores across machines with automatic git merges
- [ ] Open the previous entry as a vim split window
- [ ] Add a tasklist that is a singleton(one file) | open this as a split window in vim
- [ ] Identify tasks mentioned in the previous entry like shower or exercise and present a checklist for that task in the new entry
- [x] Use a config file stored in $HOME/.journal-config.json or something to point to the journal git repository
- [ ] Enable the editor to be configurable
