# Working towards Idea Storage
After a break due to my back being a little off, I'm back with a vengeance.
Took an hour or so to come up with the new entry type plan.
Wrote the spec a few different times before I landed on the current one in `entry/entry_test.go`.
I'm pretty happy with it now and I think I've isolated the functionality it's supposed to contribute.

This should culminate with Idea Storage as I complete the factorization.
A few questions still remain as to the structure, I will lay them out in an Idea.
