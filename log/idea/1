## [active] [1] Idea Management
To make an Idea inactive you change the status to inactive in the journal entry.
An inactive Idea will not be visible when writing the next entry.

To make an Idea active you type some sort of valid go template command.

Something like this perhaps?:
{{.Task.Find("Idea Manager")}}

Saving the entry will trigger journal to parse the file and expand any templates it finds.
Then when the idea is present in the entry you can mark it as active.
