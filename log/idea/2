## [inactive] [2] Ideas and Tasks
Going to archive this for a bit.
No need to keep it around for now.

This is an Idea.

Currently Idea's cannot be renamed.
A way to fix this is to give an Idea a unique ID.
By default maybe it doesn't have an Id
- [ ] An Idea can have an Id

All tasks will be bound to an Idea.
Expected line form will be as follows.

- [ ] Task - {{.TaskText}}
- [ ] An Idea can have tasks

- [x] To find the currently active ideas, you search the previous journal entry.
- [x] All active Ideas found in the previous entry will be carried over to a new entry.
- [x] An inactive or completed idea doesn't get carried over to a new entry

If a task is checked off in an journal entry it is removed from the ideas task list with a commit.
The commit is seperate from the commit for the journal entry itself.

To make an Idea inactive you change the status to inactive in the journal entry.
An inactive Idea will not be carried into the next new entry.
To make an Idea active you type some sort of valid go template command.

Something like this perhaps?:
{{.Task.Find("Ideas and Tasks")}}

And then when you save the entry file `journal` will use the file as a template and expand it.

- [ ] Vim snippets and maybe a filetype definition with closes'm going to open an Idea concerning missing specifications.
