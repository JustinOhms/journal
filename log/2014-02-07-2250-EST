#~ Plan to finish up `fix` command
This shouldn't take more then an hour or so.
And watch it take 6 hours -.-

Going to do the last task for fixing entries.
The FixedEntry() method needs to return a commitable with the right message format.

## [active] `fix` command
- [ ] Mark fix beginning with an empty git commit
    - message "FIX - Journal - Begin"

- [ ] fix journal
    - fix | does NOT store ideas in `idea/` directory
        - fix ideas
    - fix | has entries that don't conform to the current feature set
        - fix entries
    - fix | does NOT store entries in `entry/` directory
        - create `entry/` directory and move all entries
        - message "FIX - Journal - Moved all entries to entry/ directory"

- [ ] fix ideas
    - [ ] create `idea/` directory structure
        - message "FIX - Journal - Created idea/ directory structure"
    - [ ] Parse ideas from entries starting from oldest
        - If an idea doesn't exist in `idea/' w/ matching name
            - Create the idea
            - message "FIX - Idea - Created - {timestamp}"
        - If an idea exists in `idea/` /w matching name
            - Update the idea
            - message "FIX - Idea - Modified - {timestamp}"

- [X] fix entries
    - [X] fix | does NOT have a closed timestamp as the final line
        - append a closed timestamp for 30secs after opened timestamp

    - [X] fix | does NOT have a commit message header w/ format
        - format "# Commit Message\n"
        - change "#~ Text\n" -> "# Text\n"
        - change
```
#~ Text
#  More Text
```

to

```
# Text | More Text
```

    - [X] fix | does have ideas in the body
        - remove ideas

    - [X] Current Features
        - should have a timestamp as the first line
        - should have a commit msg line w/ format "# Commit Msg\n"
        - should NOT have any ideas in the body
        - should have a timestamp as the final line

    - [ ] return a commitable with msg format
        - format "entry - {filename} - format updated"

- [ ] Mark fix complete with an empty git commit
    - message "FIX - Journal - Complete"
