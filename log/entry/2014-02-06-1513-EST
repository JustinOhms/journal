#~ Completed the directory storage for ideas
Implemented the final remaining specs for the idea directory store.
Works as expected, pretty excited about this.

Everything should be ready now to build the journal-fix command.
Once that's completed I'll be able to rewrite the journal-new command.
Then combine journal-fix and journal-new into the single command journal.

Really enjoyed writing code today with this new procedure.
Writing the entire spec and then the entire implementation is beautiful.
Though I am wondering if I should be trading back and forth more often.

What if my spec's aren't actually covering the implementation?
Maybe I should go back through once more and verify each spec is upholding it's clause.

## [completed] `idea/` directory
- [X] initialize an empty directory
    - [X] with the next available idea of 1
    - [X] with an empty active idea index
    - [X] and return a commitable

- [X] `idea/nextid` will store the next available id
- [X] `idea/active` will index which ideas are active
    - [X] 1 id per line

- [X] Create a new idea
    - [X] Retrieve nextid and increment
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange
    - [X] Write idea to `idea/{id}`
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange
    - [X] If it is active, append id to `idea/active` index
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange

    - [X] Create a Commitable with all [2|3] changes and a msg
        - [X] commit message format "IDEA - {id} - Created"

- [X] Update an existing idea
    - [X] Write idea to `idea/{id}`
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange
    - [X] If it is active, make sure it exists in `idea/active` index
        - [X] If modified return a CommitableChange
    - [X] If it is inactive, make sure it doesn't exist in `idea/active` index
        - [X] If modified return a CommitableChange

    - [X] Create a Commitable with all 2 changes and a msg
        - [X] msg format "IDEA - {id} - Updated"
