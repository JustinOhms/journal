#~ Assessing and modifying my existing plan for Journal version 1
Recently have been piddling around with completing version 1.
Last week I worked on some of the spec for the `journal/init` package.
When I was working last week I did not look over this plan.

I updated the pathing to the cmd_verbs package hierarchy.
Looking over my work from last week I believe the specification for "A function to check if journal directory can be initialized" has been completed; along with the implementation.
On top of that, I'm quite proud of the code produced as well.
It is clean and concise and reading the spec was pretty straightforward.

Continuing forward I am going to apply the same principles I used during this process.
    - Write the spec
        - Fix any spec failures so the response is unambiguous and it is apparent what exactly failed.
    - Write the implementation

So my immediate plan is to finish the spec and implementation of the `journal/init` package.
After that is complete I will implement the `journal init` command as a cmd_verb.

## [active] package journal/init
- [x] A function to check if journal directory can be initialized
    - [x] Create specification
        - does directory exist?
            - yes - is directory empty?
                - yes - directory can be initialized
                - no  - directory can NOT be initialized
            - no  - directory can be initialized

- [ ] A function to check if a directory has been initialized
    - [ ] Create specification
        - is directory in a git repository?
            - yes - If entry directory exists and idea directory store exists
                - yes - journal has been initialized
                - no  - journal has not been initialized
            - no  - journal has not been initialized

- [ ] A function to initialize a journal directory
    - [ ] Create specification
        - create entry directory
        - create idea directory store


## [active] package journal/fix
- [ ] A function to check if a journal directory can be fixed
    - is directory initialized?
        - yes - can NOT be fixed
        - no  - does directory contain entries?
            - yes - can be fixed
            - no  - can NOT be fixed

- [ ] A function to check if a journal directory needs to be fixed
    - is directory initialized?
        - yes - does not need fixed
        - no  - does directory contain entries?
            - yes - needs fixed
            - no  - needs initialized


## [active] package journal/cmd
This is package is routines shared by all command packages.
I expect this package can be extracted into it's own project in the future.

- [ ] journal/cmd
    - [ ] ALL commands MUST accept the -h flag

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/init
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -ignore-git | Will not run `git init` on the journal directory.
                          | Will not commit an changes in the directory to git repository.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/fix
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -ignore-git     | Will not commit any fixes or modifications to git
        - [ ] -print-hash-log | Print out the hash log and commit messages for the entire fix.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/new
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -ignore-git | Will not commit any ideas from the new entry or the entry itself to git.
        - [ ] -no-edit    | Will not open the entry in an interactive editor
                          | This options implies -ignoregit because the entry created will not be committed.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/help
    - example usage
```
>$ journal help init
Print formatted usage and options for `init` command.
>$ journal help new
Print formatted usage and options for `new` command.
```
    - [ ] will only accept registered commands as an argument
    - [ ] will execute the registered command with -h flag as the only argument


## [active] journal version 1
- [ ] idea "package journal/cmd" completed
- [ ] commands implemented
    - [ ] journal init
    - [ ] journal fix
    - [ ] journal new
    - [ ] journal help
