# journal - Enabling spelling was an easy upgrade
I tried using a raw string like `+"set spell"` and it didn't work.
exec.Command() must be doing something to the argument strings.
Or maybe the quotes are consumed by bash, but not by the system level process executor.
So that's why `vim +"set spell" file` worked from bash.

Anyway, quick nice little fix!
