#~ LOG | Mostly finished the journal/init package
Completed the specification and implementation of the functions provided by the `journal/init` package.
I believe the specifications cover all the use cases.
When I'm implementing the command I believe I will have to bubble a git.Commitable object from the `init.Journal(directory)` function.

I'm going to move forward and implement the `journal init` command.
I've modified the proposed flags for `journal init` to align with the immediate uses of the command.

## [active] journal version 1
- [ ] idea "package journal/cmd" completed
- [ ] commands implemented
    - [ ] journal init - WIP
    - [ ] journal fix
    - [ ] journal new
    - [ ] journal help

## [active] package journal/cmd
This is package is routines shared by all command packages.
I expect this package can be extracted into it's own project in the future.

- [ ] journal/cmd
    - [ ] ALL commands MUST accept the -h flag

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/init
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -no-commit | Will not commit an changes in the directory to git repository.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/fix
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -ignore-git     | Will not commit any fixes or modifications to git
        - [ ] -print-hash-log | Print out the hash log and commit messages for the entire fix.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/new
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -ignore-git | Will not commit any ideas from the new entry or the entry itself to git.
        - [ ] -no-edit    | Will not open the entry in an interactive editor
                          | This options implies -ignoregit because the entry created will not be committed.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/help
    - example usage
```
>$ journal help init
Print formatted usage and options for `init` command.
>$ journal help new
Print formatted usage and options for `new` command.
```
    - [ ] will only accept registered commands as an argument
    - [ ] will execute the registered command with -h flag as the only argument
