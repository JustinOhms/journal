# Assessing and modifying my existing plan for Journal version 1
Recently have been piddling around with completing version 1.
Last week I worked on some of the spec for the `journal/init` package.
When I was working last week I did not look over this plan.

I updated the pathing to the cmd_verbs package hierarchy.
Looking over my work from last week I believe the specification for "A function to check if journal directory can be initialized" has been completed; along with the implementation.
On top of that, I'm quite proud of the code produced as well.
It is clean and concise and reading the spec was pretty straightforward.

Continuing forward I am going to apply the same principles I used during this process.
    - Write the spec
        - Fix any spec failures so the response is unambiguous and it is apparent what exactly failed.
    - Write the implementation

So my immediate plan is to finish the spec and implementation of the `journal/init` package.
After that is complete I will implement the `journal init` command as a cmd_verb.
