# Wake up check in
Made some QoL changes to the main func.
Fixed a few bugs I found.
Did all this last night before I went to sleep.
None of it's spec'ed out, but that's today's task.

Was reading a blog article from r/golang about a company, dramafever, transistioning their server to go.
I liked a few of the ideas mentioned, but there was something big that I didn't know about.

```shell
$> go test -cover
```

Oh
My
God

This new metric is going to rule me.
Going to get some food.
I might check in and make a list before I get started today, after I eat.
Maybe make an Idea for each day.
So the begin check in makes an Idea.
And the end check in completes tasks and hopefully completes the Idea as a whole.
