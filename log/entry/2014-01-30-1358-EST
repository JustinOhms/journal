# Completed Non-Error Specification of the entry package
Completed all the non error specifications for the entry package.
The one error case I really care about is if an Entry is missing a Commit message.
I think this error case can be handled by the package user to reopen the editor.
It needs to be checked during Close() and the file shouldn't be modified.
