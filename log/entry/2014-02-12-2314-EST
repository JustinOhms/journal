# Journal Version 1 Plan
Working on a design to implement commands.
My current idea is to store routines shared by all commands in the package journal/cmd.
Then implement each separate command in a subdirectory package (see idea "package journal/cmd").

The idea behind this strategy is isolation and compartmentalization of each commands execution environment.
This should also help to eliminate the main_test.go specifications in favor of direct testing of each commands.
I want to eliminate these specifications because they are a bottleneck that will not scale.
This is due to actually executing the journal command via os/exec.

If this proves to be too compartmentalized then each command package can be combined into a single package, journal/cmd.
This package could still be extracted later as a stand alone project in either format.
