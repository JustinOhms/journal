# Making Progress
I think I've identified the path forward now.
I'm going to implement the `fix` command.
By doing this first I'll be using my new packages and paving the way to re-implement the `new` command.
It also doesn't make much sense to implement the `new` command without a journal to use it on.
Opening a new Idea for the `fix` command.
