# Finished up package git's expected usage pattern
First package I've made where I worked on it w/ godoc for it open in the browser.
Helped me write documentation as I updated the package.
It might be the most documented package I've made.

I think I will continue writting packages like this.
Going to move forward with the fix command.

Updated the plan for the fix command with some more in depth steps.
