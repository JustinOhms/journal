# Implemented creating a new idea in the idea directory
Specified and implemented the method to store new ideas in a directory.

The method from my last entry worked really really well this time.
By writing the skeleton specification and then the documenting the interface,
the interface designs itself.

This is a really productive feeling and want to keep riding it the rest of today.

Going to go take an exercise break and make some coffee.
