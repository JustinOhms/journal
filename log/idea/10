## [inactive] [10] Event Identification
Something along the lines of, I mention in my entry that I'm going to sleep.
So the next entry asks me if I did, and around what time.

Using that data you could data mine your sleep patterns, doesn't require any high tech instruments either.
Use the Journal 2 times daily and when you wake up and before you sleep and you can monitor sleep patterns.

Other events that could be Identified that I'd like to monitor and mine for data are, Shower, Brushing Teeth, number 2 etc.
Some of these events like Showers I want to present a checklist for so I can monitor the consistency of my routine.
