# Updated the git.Commitable interface
The user shouldn't be adding changes to the index in a non atomic way.
Using the git.Commit() function is atomic.
All the changes from the Commitable are added and committed.

Room for optimization by combining all `git add` call's into 1.

Of note, the git.Commit() function doesn't care if the index is already dirty.
