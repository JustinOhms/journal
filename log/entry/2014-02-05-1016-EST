# Working on the idea directory management
This session has been really productive.

I wrote everything in this order 

-> specification skeleton ->
    -> documentation and type'ing ->
    -> specification ->
    -> implementation

Working like this feels extremely productive and design oriented.
It also focuses on the functionality and the documentation above all.
Writing the spec skeleton makes a flowing todo list.
Writing the documentation produces types and public behavior.
Having that documentation helps to write the details of the specification.
a.k.a the expected public behavior.

Happy with this method and I hope it continues to feel as productive.
