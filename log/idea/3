## [active] [3] Software Architecture
I'm not exactly happy with what's happening due to this rapid feature adding.
Everything sort of getting out of hand, haha.
It's not quite there but some of the functions are really long.

I'd really like to revisit the Idea parser for some readability improvements.

I also have a way to handle the pre and post processing of the entry.

- [ ] Extract the entry into a type, currently it's just a big function
- [ ] Identify a common interface for Pre and Post processes
- [ ] Extract all current modifications into these Pre and Post processors
- [ ] Chain them together

Regarding the `type Command` that was yanked from the go cmd.
It isn't really all that useful.
I think it'd be a good Idea to revisit this structure and simplify it.
Nothing from the struct itself is needed by the `new` command during execution

I'd like to get the command itself fully spec'ed.
Just today I realized how to test the command as used from the terminal.
Pretty proud of that realization, it will be useful in the future.
