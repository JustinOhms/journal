# Finished with the journal-fix command
As far as I'm concerned the `journal-fix` command is now complete.
I've left out a `CanBeFixed()` function because it isn't needed.
If fixing fails, it fails.

Maybe I could prompt, "Would you like to backup the journal before fixing?"
I dunno, I'm not all that worried about it honestly.

With this out of the way I should be able to complete version 1 fairly soon.
I estimate 2 days of work to implement the `new` command.
Then a few hours to make sure all the documentation is consistent across the commands.
Once that's all completed and I have a functioning command I may go back and work on some missing options.
Or I'll just wrap it up, write up an extensive README and call it done for now.

If it's functional enough I can start using the new format and working on the game engine.
As I work, I expect I'll find some features that would be useful and I'll be able to start planning those out.
Then once I pile up a few useful features I can spec and impl them and see how this project's growth feels.
If it is too rigid I'll need to take a step back and really assess how the tests are written.
Looking for way to remove any binding's to the impl wherever possible and enable more fluidity.
