## [inactive] [20] `git add` and deleted files
It might be nice to experiment with using types to solve the `git add` issue.
The current solution is a hack that adds `--all` to the args list to `git add`.
Would be be to use interfacing and types to determine what `git index` modification takes place.

These 3 types are what I have in mind.

```go
type DeletedFile string

type NewFile string

type ModifiedFile string
```

They should satisfy an interface like this.

```go
type IndexModification interface {
    ModifyIndex() error
}
```

Then each respective type can `git add` or `git rm` or whatever it needs to get the change it represents into the index before a commit takes place.
