# Working implementation of the `journal-init` command completed
While I was working through this I learned a few things about the cmd package.
First, for testability, I had to add a `SetWd(string)` method to the interface.
This ensures that each instance of a command verb can execute within it's own context and enabled testing.
Second, for the actual single verb executable to have customized usage it had to provide the flagset to the verb constructor.
Doing this enables wrapping customizing the usage for the command in the context of a single verb executable.
I also think this will enable pretty usage for the multi verb executable as well, wait and see.

I also noticed that the fix function in the `journal/fix` package commit's it's own changes.
This may need to be changed so that they are bubbled out to the caller as I did with the `journal/init` package.
Though, this may not be technically feasible, but a quick glance over the source didn't glean if it was or wasn't.

Thinking I'll work on the fix verb & executable tomorrow.

OH, also.
I didn't really clarify much about the commit sequence executed by the `init` verb.
Something is nagging me that in the future there will be more then the single commit generated by initialization;
So I guess I was just leaving it until then.
I did verify manually that it was working correctly, so I know it works, but it would be nice to have it solidified.
