# journal - Some higher order feature ideas
- In corporate todo.txt into journal
- Enable journal to be aware of multiple journal data endpoints
    - Examples
        - personal
        - work
        - project/name
    - Do content analysis to avoid
    breaches in information from personal/private
    from being added to a project journal
     - Use CLA to register identify anomalies in work
     related journals compared to private journals
- Branch and register each change made during an editing session
    - Use this data to train a CLA on the differences in editing style
    - Can use this data to do anomaly detection to avoid breaches
    - Can also be used to form a more accurate time estimation on editing duration
    - Could produce more accurate results about editing time if
    I walked away, mid edit, for 10 mins
