#~ Beginning work on `journal-fix` command and verb
I've decided that the 2 options being passed to fix are pretty worthless.
The only option I see that I NEEED right now it maybe -check.
I need this becuase this state should be checked if something errors during `journal-new`

Nevermind, I think the -no-commit option is important enough that I should add it.

## [active] journal version 1
- [ ] idea "package journal/cmd" completed
- [ ] commands implemented
    - [x] journal init
    - [ ] journal fix
    - [ ] journal new
    - [ ] journal help


## [active] package journal/fix
- [ ] A function to check if a journal directory can be fixed
    - is directory initialized?
        - yes - can NOT be fixed
        - no  - does directory contain entries?
            - yes - can be fixed
            - no  - can NOT be fixed

- [ ] A function to check if a journal directory needs to be fixed
    - is directory initialized?
        - yes - does not need fixed
        - no  - does directory contain entries?
            - yes - needs fixed
            - no  - needs initialized


## [active] package journal/cmd
This is package is routines shared by all command packages.
I expect this package can be extracted into it's own project in the future.

- [ ] journal/cmd
    - [ ] ALL commands MUST accept the -h flag

- [x] package journal/cmd_verbs/init
    - [x] options
        - [x] -no-commit | Will not commit an changes in the directory to git repository.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/fix
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -no-commit | Will not commit any of the modifications when fixing the journal's structure and data
        - [ ] -check     | Will run a check on the journal to see if it needs fixing

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/new
    - [ ] options
        - [ ] -ignore-git | Will not commit any ideas from the new entry or the entry itself to git.
        - [ ] -no-edit    | Will not open the entry in an interactive editor
                          | This options implies -ignoregit because the entry created will not be committed.

- [ ] package journal/cmd_verbs/help
    - example usage
```
>$ journal help init
Print formatted usage and options for `init` command.
>$ journal help new
Print formatted usage and options for `new` command.
```
    - [ ] will only accept registered commands as an argument
    - [ ] will execute the registered command with -h flag as the only argument
