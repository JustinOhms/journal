#~ Implemented creating a new idea in the idea directory
Specified and implemented the method to store new ideas in a directory.

The method from my last entry worked really really well this time.
By writing the skeleton specification and then the documenting the interface,
the interface designs itself.

This is a really productive feeling and want to keep riding it the rest of today.

Going to go take an exercise break and make some coffee.

[twitch session](http://www.twitch.tv/pippipong/b/500966790)

## [active] `idea/` directory
- [X] initialize an empty directory
    - [X] with the next available idea of 1
    - [X] with an empty active idea index
    - [X] and return a commitable

- [X] `idea/nextid` will store the next available id
- [ ] `idea/active` will index which ideas are active
    - [ ] 1 id per line

- [X] Create a new idea
    - [X] Retrieve nextid and increment
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange
    - [X] Write idea to `idea/{id}`
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange
    - [X] If it is active, append id to `idea/active` index
        - [X] Returns a CommitableChange

    - [X] Create a Commitable with all 3 changes and a msg
