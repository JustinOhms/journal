# Beginning work on `journal-fix` command and verb
I've decided that the 2 options being passed to fix are pretty worthless.
The only option I see that I NEEED right now it maybe -check.
I need this becuase this state should be checked if something errors during `journal-new`

Nevermind, I think the -no-commit option is important enough that I should add it.
