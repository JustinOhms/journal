# In the middle of implementing fix.NeedsFixed()
My work today has consisted of scowling at what I wrote 1 year ago.
The more productive area from today was shrinking the fix package's public interface.

I'm in the middle of implementing the public interface of.

``` go
NeedsFixed(directory string) (bool, error)
Fix(directory string) (refLog []string, error)
```

I'm leaning on not implementing the, CanBeFixed() function.
Reasoning being I want to get this done and it really isn't all that nesscary.
Maybe in the future I'll worry about it when I come back I significantly modify the disk storage format and rebuild the fix package.
But for now I'm the only user and I just need to get this overwith and move forward.

The NeedsFixed() function has an error in it.
It is walking into lower directories when it shouldn't be.
I just identified this as an issue and I need to move forward with fixing it.
